# Next in Magic Venue
Right after the ceremony, the newlyweds will want to stay with you in the Venue for a pleasant lunch prepared by the Venue Staff.

All of it will enjoy the mostly jazz background notes of the band Novemuse.

The day will close in the late afternoon / early evening going wild and dancing. Don't keep your dancing self back.
