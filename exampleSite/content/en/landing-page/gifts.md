Paolo and Clementina's only aim is to spend a lovely day celebrating their love with the closest persons to them. They'd like to feel at ease and make feel at ease every single guest, so they decided to not ask anything specifically. And hey who said there should really be a gift after all? :satisfied:

If you really want to make a present, Paolo and Clementina would only ask to keep in mind that they will travel back to Scotland, so please avoid some bulky objects. Or please avoid envelopes full of cash (I guess if you're reading this section in english you may not know that, but it's still a pretty common use in Apulia and South Italy :worried: )

So if you'd really like to make a present, why not help Paolo and Clementina organise their next trip by making a donation to the travel agency Squadro in Bari?

The list is called Barile - Zaccaria and you can reach out the agency with:

Squadro Viaggi - via Antonio Lucarelli, 52, Bari
